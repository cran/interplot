\arguments{
\item{m}{A model object including an interaction term, or, alternately, a data frame recording conditional coefficients. This data frame should includes four columns:
\itemize{
   \item fake: The sequence of \code{var1} (the item whose effect will be conditioned on in the interaction);
   \item coef1: The point estimates of the coefficient of \code{var1} at each break point.
   \item ub: The upper bound of the simulated 95\% CI.
   \item lb: The lower bound of the simulated 95\% CI.
}}

\item{var1}{The name (as a string) of the variable of interest in the interaction term; its conditional coefficient estimates will be plotted.}

\item{var2}{The name (as a string) of the other variable in the interaction term.}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether the output is a plot or a dataframe including the conditional coefficient estimates of var1, their upper and lower bounds, and the corresponding values of var2.}

\item{steps}{Desired length of the sequence. A non-negative number, which for seq and seq.int will be rounded up if fractional. The default is 100 or the unique categories in the \code{var2} (when it is less than 100. Also see \code{\link{unique}}).}

\item{ci}{is a numeric value inherited from the data wrangling functions in this package. Adding it here is just for the method consistency.}

\item{adjCI}{Succeeded from the data management functions in `interplot` package.}

\item{hist}{A logical value indicating if there is a histogram of `var2` added at the bottom of the conditional effect plot.}

\item{var2_dt}{A numerical value indicating the frequency distribution of `var2`. It is only used when `hist == TRUE`. When the object is a model, the default is the distribution of `var2` of the model.}

\item{predPro}{A logical value with default of `FALSE`. When the `m` is an output of a general linear model (class `glm` or `glmerMod`) and the argument is set to `TRUE`, the function will plot predicted probabilities at the values given by `var2_vals`.}

\item{var2_vals}{A numerical value indicating the values the predicted probabilities are estimated, when `predPro` is `TRUE`.}

\item{point}{A logical value determining the format of plot. By default, the function produces a line plot when var2 takes on ten or more distinct values and a point (dot-and-whisker) plot otherwise; option TRUE forces a point plot.}

\item{sims}{Number of independent simulation draws used to calculate upper and lower bounds of coefficient estimates: lower values run faster; higher values produce smoother curves.}

\item{xmin}{A numerical value indicating the minimum value shown of x shown in the graph. Rarely used.}

\item{xmax}{A numerical value indicating the maximum value shown of x shown in the graph. Rarely used.}

\item{ercolor}{A character value indicating the outline color of the whisker or ribbon.}

\item{esize}{A numerical value indicating the size of the whisker or ribbon.}

\item{ralpha}{A numerical value indicating the transparency of the ribbon.}

\item{rfill}{A character value indicating the filling color of the ribbon.}

\item{stats_cp}{A character value indicating what statistics to present as the plot note. Three options are available: "none", "ci", and "ks". The default is "none". See the Details for more information.}

\item{txt_caption}{A character string to add a note for the plot, a value will sending to \code{ggplot2::labs(caption = txt_caption))}.}

\item{ci_diff}{A numerical vector with a pair of values indicating the confidence intervals of the difference between \code{var1} and \code{var2}.}

\item{ks_diff}{A \code{ks.test} object of the effect of \code{var1} conditioned on \code{var2}.}

\item{...}{Other ggplot aesthetics arguments for points in the dot-whisker plot or lines in the line-ribbon plots. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Graph based on the data frame of statistics about the conditional effect of an interaction.
}
\details{
\code{interplot.plot} is a S3 method from the \code{interplot}. It generates plots of conditional coefficients.

Because the output function is based on \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}, any additional arguments and layers supported by \code{ggplot2} can be added with the \code{+}. 

\code{interplot} visualizes the conditional effect based on simulated marginal effects. The simulation provides a probabilistic distribution of moderation effect of the conditioning variable (\code{var2}) at every preset values (including the minimum and maximum values) of the conditioned variable (\code{var1}), denoted as Emin and Emax. This output allows the function to further examine the conditional effect statistically in two ways. One is to examine if the distribution of \eqn{Emax - Emin} covers zero. The other is to directly compare Emin and Emax through statistical tools for distributional comparisons. Users can choose either method by setting the argument \code{stats_cp} to "ci" or "ks".
\itemize{
  \item "ci" provides the confidence interval of the difference of \eqn{Emax - Emin}. An interval including 0 suggests no statistical difference before and after the conditional effect is applied, and vise versa.
  \item "ks" presents the result of a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the simulated distributions of Emin and Emax. The output includes a D statistics and a p-value of the null hypothesis that the two distributions come from the same distribution at the 0.05 level.
